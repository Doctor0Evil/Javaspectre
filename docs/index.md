# Javaspectre & ALN

Javaspectre is a spectral-grade AI framework that turns conceptual uncertainty into executable JavaScript, reproducible repositories, and world-ready architectures.

ALN (Augmented Language Networks) is the **orchestration language** Javaspectre speaks. It defines how intents, constraints, environments, and artifacts are represented so that AI chats, GitHub workflows, and Chromium/XR runtimes can share a common planning layer.

- See **aln-language.md** for the ALN intent schema and examples.
- See **chromium-xr.md** for browser and XR integration patterns.
- See **ecosystem.md** for editor plugins, CI patterns, and integration guides.
