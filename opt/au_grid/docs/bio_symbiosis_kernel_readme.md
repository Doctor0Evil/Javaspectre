- Deployment target: Linux or Windows servers with standard TLS 1.3 stacks, Prometheus, and container orchestration.[file:4][file:5]
- No control channels to implants, stimulators, or experimental EMF hardware are permitted; all bindings must terminate at dashboards or non-actuating XR clients.[file:4][file:5]
