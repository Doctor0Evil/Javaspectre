# Javaspectre Code of Conduct

Javaspectre is committed to fostering a collaborative, transparent, and sustainability-aware ecosystem where contributors can safely explore the frontiers of spectral automation and Augmented Language Networks (ALN). This document outlines expected behavior and community standards for all participants.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in the Javaspectre project and community an experience free from harassment, hostility, or abuse — regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our work advances **creative expression through code** and strives to **maximize positive planetary impact**. We hold every interaction to a standard of mutual respect, curiosity, and responsibility.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness to others.  
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences.  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.  
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community.  
- Acting with transparency and integrity when proposing or reviewing code.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, deliberate intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.  
- Derogatory comments, trolling, or personal attacks.  
- Publishing private information without explicit consent.  
- Persistently disruptive or off-topic behavior in community spaces.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may take appropriate corrective or disciplinary action, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from collaboration spaces.

Maintainers will base decisions on the following principles:

1. **Clarity** – Explain which behavior was unacceptable and why.  
2. **Education** – Give the contributor an opportunity to acknowledge and correct their behavior.  
3. **Consistency** – Apply rules evenly across all participants, regardless of status or contribution level.  
4. **Integrity** – Keep enforcement outcomes transparent while respecting privacy and dignity.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by contacting the Javaspectre maintainers through the GitHub repository’s issue tracker or via direct message. All complaints will be reviewed promptly and confidentially.

Reports should include:

- A clear description of the issue.  
- Links, screenshots, or context where appropriate.  
- Any previous message history relevant to the incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces — including GitHub discussions, pull requests, documentation comments, and live community events — as well as public interactions where an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Consequences

Failure to adhere to this Code of Conduct may result in revoked access to commit privileges, community channels, or related resources. In serious cases, it may trigger permanent suspension from active participation.

## Acknowledgment

This Code is derived in spirit from the Contributor Covenant and adapted to reflect Javaspectre’s mission of **spectral-grade AI development**, **ethical automation**, and **transparent sustainability**.
