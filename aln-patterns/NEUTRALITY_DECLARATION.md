# Neutrality Declaration

This repository provides patterns intended to support:

- Cybernetic and non-cybernetic runtimes
- Smart-city infrastructure and traditional IT stacks
- Human–AI assisted development workflows
- Public-sector and private-sector deployments

without:

- Binding to any specific ledger, token, or economics model
- Embedding any ecosystem-specific identifiers or trademarks
- Encoding medical, BCI, or game-specific semantics

Projects MAY:

- Reuse and adapt patterns for energy management, safety, reconciliation, or introspection.
- Integrate these patterns into legal, regulated, or mission-critical contexts.

Projects MUST:

- Apply their own domain-specific safety, ethics, and legal layers.
- Keep any domain coupling out of this repository.
