# aln-patterns

A neutral repository of reusable architectural patterns, ALN schema patterns,
event-sourcing patterns, reconciliation strategies, and introspective
object-excavation techniques.

This repository is:

- Project-agnostic
- Ledger-agnostic
- Runtime-agnostic
- Free of gameplay, browser, or cybernetic-brand semantics

## Purpose

The goal is to provide patterns that can be adopted by:

- Research and experimental stacks
- Production runtimes (including smart-city infrastructure)
- Public-sector and private-sector platforms
- Human–AI assisted development workflows

without binding them to any specific ecosystem.

## Guarantees

- No project-specific names (no game titles, no platform brands)
- No AU.ET/CSP, BCI, or device-specific coupling
- All content is reusable as inspiration or reference only
