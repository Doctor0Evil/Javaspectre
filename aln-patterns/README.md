# aln-patterns

A neutral repository of reusable architectural patterns, ALN schema patterns, 
event-sourcing patterns, reconciliation strategies, and introspective 
object-excavation techniques.

This repository contains **no project-specific logic** and **no domain coupling**.

All patterns are:

- Project-agnostic  
- Ledger-agnostic  
- Runtime-agnostic  
- Free of gameplay, browser, or cybernetic semantics  
- Safe to import as inspiration into any ecosystem  

Use these patterns as reference material when designing:

- Reconciliation systems  
- Manifest hashing  
- Append-only event logs  
- Structural/semantic object classification  
- ALN schema design  
- Repository introspection tools
