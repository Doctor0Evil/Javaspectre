# PROJECT BOUNDARY — JavaSpectre Runtime

JavaSpectre manages browser/VNode intelligence, repository manifests, and mirror reconciliation.

## Hard rules

- This repo is ONLY for:
  - Browser/VNode profiles
  - SessionTickets
  - RepoManifest and mirror management
  - Introspective repository/code/manifest excavation
- Do NOT introduce:
  - Cell gameplay logic, horror mechanics, or runtime events
  - AU.ET/CSP, BCI, EEG, neuromorphic, or CEM energy/safety logic

## AI assistant guidance

AI assistants:
- Work exclusively with:
  - VNodes, SessionTickets, RepoManifest, reconciliation, and object excavation in code/data space.
- Do NOT:
  - Add horror/gameplay events.
  - Add AU.ET/CSP or CEM safety modules.
- JavaSpectre may read repos (including Cell or CyberCore) for classification, but NEVER writes to them.
