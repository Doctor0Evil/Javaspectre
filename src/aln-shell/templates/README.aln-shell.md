# ALN Web Kernel Shell

This repository was generated by **Javaspectre – ALN Web Kernel** and ships a static, zero-IDE HTML dashboard shell plus a minimal Node/WebSocket bridge for EEG and IoT streams.

## Contents

- `aln-augmented-user-kernel.html` – Static ALN dashboard shell (no build step).
- `ws-bridge.js` – Node-based WebSocket bridge that serves the HTML and emits demo signals.
- `package.json` – Scripts for running the bridge and installing dependencies.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

npm install

2. Run the WebSocket bridge:

node ws-bridge.js


3. Open the ALN shell in a browser:

- Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/`
- The shell will connect to `ws://localhost:8080/signals` for live data.

## Wiring to EEG / IoT

You can replace the demo signal generator in `ws-bridge.js` with a real device bridge:

- **OpenBCI / BrainFlow / LSL**  
- Use a local Python script to read EEG via BrainFlow and stream JSON over WebSocket to this Node server.[file:1]  
- **Muse / WebBluetooth**  
- Use a browser-side WebBluetooth client to connect directly to Muse and write values into `data-aln-signal`-annotated elements.[file:1]  
- **Smart-city / IoT**  
- Connect this bridge to low-bandwidth edge nodes and forward their events to the ALN shell as `type: "aln-signal"` JSON frames.[file:1]

## Energy & Edge Profile

- Static HTML, no build tools, no server-side rendering.[file:1]  
- Bridge can run on small edge devices (Raspberry Pi or similar) and expose low-power dashboards for BCI, neuromorphic, or smart-city telemetry.[file:1]
